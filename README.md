# Jekyll Academic Template 

This is a minimal, beautiful Jekyll site optimized for academic profiles.
Replace placeholder content (index.md, teaching.md, publications.md) with your own.

To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io` (or any name and set pages branch).
2. Push this repository.
3. GitHub Pages will serve the site automatically (for user site use the special repo name above).
